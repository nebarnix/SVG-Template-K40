# Image WalkDown
Make a template in inkscape using $1 thru $5. Feel free to use this same template to actually cut your jig for more better aligningedness.
The page size sets the laserable area. Do not jog the laser before you cut (instead, move things on your template to change the cutting locations). It helps to make the page size the same size as the laserable area of your laser, but it is referenced to the top left corner, so that is not strictly neccesary. Make sure your jig is referenced to one or more machine datums (jam the jig into a freakin corner so you can always put it back exactly between jobs)

Save the file as template.svg AND ALSO work.svg
Now close inkscape. (or don't? I don't really care)

Open K40 whisperer. Load work.svg

Open the namer maker goer (you'll need autohotkeys installed)
![alt text](https://github.com/nebarnix/SVG-Template-K40/blob/master/NamerMakerGoer.PNG?raw=true "Template")

Press the GO button and magic will happen. Keep doing this until you have millions of pencils and your laser is but a pile of dust. (I commented out the code to press the raster engrave button because of safety concerns. The user will have to manually press the raster engrade button)
